undo:

at every change the block is cloned. The clone id is stored in the undo cue. Undo cue holds up to ten undos.
 if you click it searches for the latest undo and puts that data into the original block. 
 then the original block is put into the redo cue.
 you need an algorithm to figure out the place in the undo redo cue.
 blocks need a is_clone column
